            <p>Dubai is a major global business hub, consistently ranked among the top cities for trade, finance, and
                logistics.[22][23] The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a leading financial hub in the
                Middle East and Africa, is home to over 2,500 international companies.[24] The city is also known for
                its thriving real estate market, with $761 billion in transactions in 2024 alone.[25] It has the
                second-most five-star hotels in the world after London[26] and boasts the tallest building in the world,
                the Burj Khalifa, which stands at 828 meters (2,717 ft).</p>

            <p>After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered
                in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named
                "Fateh" or "good fortune". This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development
                plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle
                Easterners. Between 1968 and 1975, the city's population grew by over 300%.[66]

                As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of
                the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000-gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as
                "Kazzans",[67] by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop
                onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, which
                gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach),</p>
